Attack 2 Summary: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack on TaskHub

Stages of the Attack

Origins
The attack begins with an attacker identifying TaskHub as a target, focusing on its role as a project management platform with a large user base. The objective is to overload TaskHub's infrastructure, making it unavailable to legitimate users and disrupting project management for businesses.

Reconnaissance
The attacker conducts reconnaissance on TaskHub’s infrastructure, identifying the web servers, network endpoints, and services supporting the application. They look for potential vulnerabilities such as unprotected endpoints, lack of rate-limiting, or a weak content delivery network (CDN) that could make the platform more susceptible to a flood of incoming traffic.

Weaponization
The attacker assembles a botnet, which consists of thousands of compromised devices (computers, IoT devices) that can be remotely controlled. Each bot is programmed to generate massive amounts of traffic to overwhelm TaskHub’s servers. The traffic includes HTTP requests, UDP packets, or TCP SYN packets designed to consume server resources.

Delivery
The DDoS attack is launched by directing all the compromised devices in the botnet to send a flood of traffic to TaskHub’s public-facing endpoints. The aim is to overload TaskHub’s web servers, database, and network, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

Exploitation
As the flood of traffic reaches TaskHub’s infrastructure, it overwhelms the application’s web servers and network bandwidth. This leads to significant delays in response times, causing some parts of the application to become unresponsive. Users begin experiencing difficulty in accessing their projects, tasks, and communication features.

Installation
Although DDoS attacks do not involve malware installation, the attacker uses the ongoing attack to distract the security team. During the chaos, other malicious activities like reconnaissance or exploiting vulnerabilities in external services (e.g., Slack, GitHub) might be performed under the radar.

Actions on Objectives
The goal of the attacker is to render TaskHub unusable for its clients by overloading the servers. The attacker successfully brings TaskHub to a halt, resulting in:

Downtime for all users, preventing them from accessing critical project data.
Loss of revenue for businesses relying on TaskHub for project management.
Damage to reputation, as clients lose confidence in TaskHub’s ability to maintain uptime and security.
