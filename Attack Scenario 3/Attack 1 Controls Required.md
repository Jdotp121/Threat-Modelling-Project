Attack 3 Summary: SQL Injection Attack on TaskHub

Stages of the Attack

Origins

The attack begins with an attacker identifying TaskHub, a project management application with a rich user base and sensitive project data. The attacker is aware that the application processes numerous database queries, making it a prime target for a SQL injection attack, especially if input validation is weak.

Reconnaissance

The attacker conducts reconnaissance to gather information about TaskHubâ€™s web architecture and backend databases. The attacker also analyzes user interaction points where inputs are handled, such as login forms, search fields, and other data entry points. By sending various crafted inputs, the attacker probes for vulnerabilities in how the application processes SQL queries.

Weaponization

Using the information gathered, the attacker crafts malicious SQL queries designed to exploit the lack of input sanitization in TaskHub's web forms. These queries are designed to bypass normal authentication mechanisms or directly manipulate the database. For example, the attacker may inject a query that provides unauthorized access to the database or retrieves sensitive data without proper authentication.

Delivery

The attacker delivers the SQL injection payload by submitting the crafted SQL queries through vulnerable web forms, such as a login page, search field, or any other input field that interacts with the database. The malicious input is designed to trick the backend database into executing unintended commands.

Exploitation

Once the SQL injection is successfully executed, the attacker can either bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access to the database. This may allow the attacker to view, modify, or delete sensitive project data, including user credentials, project details, and internal communications. In some cases, the attacker might even escalate privileges to gain full administrative access to the TaskHub system.

Installation

To maintain persistent access, the attacker may modify the database to create additional admin accounts or inject malicious code into the database, allowing for further exploits at a later time. This persistence allows the attacker to remain in control of the system, even if initial vulnerabilities are discovered and patched.

Actions on Objectives

With unauthorized access to TaskHub's database, the attacker exfiltrates sensitive project data, such as client information, internal communications, and project timelines. The attacker might also tamper with data, modify project tasks, or delete important records. Furthermore, the attacker could disrupt TaskHub's operations by corrupting critical data or introducing malware through the database, leading to widespread impact across connected systems and services.
